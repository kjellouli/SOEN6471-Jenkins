Descriptive Statistics:-
This is a system, called DESCRIPTIVE-STATISTICS, for finding mimimum, maximum, mode, median, mean,
and standard deviation. The system should take as input a random number of data values and output its
descriptive statistics. 

Language Used:-
Java(core).

Algorithm Used for generation of random numbers:-
A linear congruential generator (LCG) is an algorithm that yields a sequence of pseudo-randomized numbers calculated with 
a discontinuous piecewise linear equation[see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator]

Note for running program:-
-Class Console represents main application and program execution starts from there.
-Class DescriptiveStatisticsTest represents test suite for execution of tests.

Extra Features:-
-TUI(Console)
-Test cases (10 test)
-Javadoc (java 1.7)
-Version control(SVN)
